## **Day 1 â€“ MongoDB & Node.js Essentials for CMS**

**Goal:** Make sure students can design and interact with MongoDB effectively inside Node.js.

### Morning Session (3 hrs)

1. **Intro to MongoDB in a CMS Context**

   * Why MongoDB for CMS (flexibility, schema design, content storage).
   * NoSQL mindset vs SQL (collections, documents, dynamic schema).

2. **Database Setup**

   * Installing/connecting MongoDB locally & Atlas cloud setup.
   * Mongoose ODM refresher (schemas, models, validations).

3. **Schema Design for CMS**

   * Content model (posts, pages, categories, tags, users).
   * Relationships in MongoDB: references vs embedding.
   * Versioning/soft deletes for CMS entries.

### Afternoon Session (3 hrs)

4. **CRUD Operations with MongoDB**

   * Creating posts/pages.
   * Updating content with validation.
   * Soft delete vs hard delete.
   * Querying with filters (e.g., category, published status).

5. **Project Work**

   * Students implement `Post` and `Category` models.
   * Build routes for CRUD in Express with MongoDB.
   * Test using Postman/Insomnia.

## **Day 2 â€“ Advanced CMS Features with MongoDB**

**Goal:** Implement richer CMS functionality and best practices.

### Morning Session (3 hrs)

6. **CMS Features**

   * Role-based access control (admin vs editor).
   * Content status: draft, published, archived.
   * Slugs & search optimization in MongoDB.
   * Pagination & sorting for posts.

7. **File Uploads & Media Library**

   * Storing metadata in MongoDB.
   * File handling (Multer, GridFS vs cloud storage).

### Afternoon Session (3 hrs)

8. **CMS Dashboard & Views**

   * Creating API endpoints for dashboard stats (post count, active users).
   * Aggregations in MongoDB (group by category, count published posts).

9. **Project Wrap-up**

   * Students integrate features into CMS:

     * CRUD posts + categories
     * Draft/publish toggle
     * Role-based access
     * Simple dashboard

10. **Deployment & Best Practices**

* Environment variables for MongoDB.
* Seeding database with initial content.
* Common pitfalls (indexes, query optimization, schema evolution).

ðŸŽ¯ **Outcome:** By the end of Day 2, students will have a **mini CMS backend with MongoDB + Node.js** supporting posts, categories, roles, and a simple dashboard.

Would you like me to also prepare a **step-by-step lab guide (tasks + expected outcomes)** for each session so students can follow along hands-on?
